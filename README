Cmput 275 Assignment 1 part 1

Required files:
-server.py
-graph.py
-binary_heap.py
-edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt 

Arduino Wiring:
	No arduino used in this part

Running the program:

-When running the server (ie python3 server.py)
This program will load the Edmonton graph and
take in a user input, and output wavepoints. 
    
-Note: if you are importing the server elsewhere,
this program will not wait for user input. It will
instead only load the map data in the edmonton text
file which you can then test the functions in your script.

Assumptions and other notes:

-We have tested this program with all the test cases
given and have gotten the correct outputs. No other notes
really too say. Run time seems fair.

Running the program:

-When running the server (ie python3 server.py)
This program will load the Edmonton graph and
take in a user input, and output wavepoints. 
    
-Note: if you are importing the server elsewhere,
this program will not wait for user input. It will
instead only load the map data in the edmonton text
file which you can then test the functions in your script.

Assumptions and other notes:

-We have tested this program with all the test cases
given and have gotten the correct outputs. The only 
note I have to say is using the test_server.py . 
In test_server.py, on the line that looks like:

print(cost.distance((1503281720, 29577354)))

the inputs given here are integers. Our server works by 
refering to vertex indentifiers as strings (if for whatever reason
the identifier is not a number) and converts the latitude and 
longditude values associated with that vertex into integers to allow 
algebraic manipulation. Since in the above line of code the input into
our cost class refers to the vertex indentifier as a integer, our code would 
not work. So to run the above line of code, you run it as:

print(cost.distance(('1503281720', '29577354')))

and this would give the correct desired output. We chose to do this because we were
testing graphs where we would call vertices indentifiers as eg: vertexA, vertexB. Other than
this one case everything should work as intended.

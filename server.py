    This program will load the Edmonton graph and
    take in a user input, and output wavepoints. Also
    includes function least_cost_path which can be used
    to find the shortest path between to vertices
    
    Note: if you are importing this file elsewhere,
    this program will not wait for user input. It will
    instead only load the map data in the edmonton text
    file and you can then test functions in your script.

            graph (Graph): The digraph defining the edges between the
            vertices.
            start: The vertex where the path starts. It is assumed

                of the edge. For more details, see the CostDistance class
                description below.

        Returns:
            least: A potentially empty list (if no path can be found) of
            the vertices in the graph. If there was a path, the first
